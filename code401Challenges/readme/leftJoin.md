# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement Left Join for two Hash Maps
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
This Challenge will get the keys from two hash maps and loop through them, check if it is the right map and add the key
and values to get a new HashMap
