## Lecture Notes: Merge Sort

This method takes an array of integers and sort them with by comparing current item with next element to the right and gives a sorted method.

### Learning Objectives
The students will learn how to sort an array of integer and test them. Students will understand the background of the sort method,
 the algorithm and the working code.

Algorithm

* write a method called insertionSort that takes in an array as argument.
* Loop through the array starting from the index 1 to th length of the array with i.
* declare temp variable for integer with value of current index
* Start another array with counter with index i-1
* Start a while loop which loops through the array until j is equal to 0 and the temp variable is less than the integer at
the index of the array.
* Assign temp to the item on the index j+1
