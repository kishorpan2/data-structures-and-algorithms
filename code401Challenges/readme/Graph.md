# Graphs
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This challenge is to implement Graphs data structure

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The approach I did is create two inner classes Node and Edge. The Node class uses theEdge class and the Graph class uses
both the Node and Edge class to write methods for the Graph class


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
### Big(O)
* Space: O(1)
* Time: O(n)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->
### Methods
* AddNode
* AddEdge
* GetNodes
* GetNeighbors
* Size
