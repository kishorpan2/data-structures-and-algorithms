# Lecture
* Merge sort is a very useful algorithm which use divide and conquer rule to solve problems
* Merge sort wil divide an array into two arrays until a single element is formed
* Then the arrays will start to merge in a sorted way looking at the two arrays and compare them and the smaller is kept
 in the array first.
* This process will take place until a single array is formed

## Learning Objectives
* Learn how to sort using this algorithm
* Learn to write a working code
