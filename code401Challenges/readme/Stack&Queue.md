# Stacks and Queues
This challenge is implementing Stack and Queues on a Linked Lists.

## Challenge
This challenge has a inner Node class. In the LinkedList class is a node property. When instantiated, an empty
 LinkedList is created. The Stack class has methods that can be able to instantiate, push, pop and peek nodes. The 
 Queue class has methods that can instantiate, enqueue, dequeue and peek the nodes.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Space: O(n) |
Memory: O(1)


## API
### Stack
* Push
* Pop
* Peek
### Queue 
* Enqueue
* Dequeue
* Peek

<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
